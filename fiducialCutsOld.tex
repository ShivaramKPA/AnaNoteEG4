\section{Fiducial Cuts}
\label{fidCuts}
% See EG4 update (Glasgow, by S.E. Kuhn) and make eps plots like those included
% include the DC shadow & granularity  figures, (may be in a separate section on Simulation/GSIM issues and refer to it from this section)

% include the Regular/EC-only 2D plots to show the CC-inefficient regions (to be discarded by some of the angular cuts)
% Show the discrepancy plots in theta and v$_z$ in data and simulation (for a few q2 bins)
%After a laborious work on getting simulation match with the data to a reasonably good degree, we did a final comparison work to determine the fiducial cuts. We obtained overlays of one-dimensional histograms of different variables, and also studied the ratios both in one and two dimensions. Based on these comparisons, regions of relatively bad matching were singled out and cuts were developed to reject such parts of the kinematic space.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{to be be elaborated more ..}}

Similar to the cuts discussed so far, we also had to match the region of good efficiency of the physical detector with the corresponding region from the simulation. For the experimental and simulation data to be comparable, they must have the same detector acceptance. %, otherwise systematic uncertainty is introduced into the calculations. 
Two event variables polar angle ($\theta_{vtx}$) measured at the vertex and the azimuthal angle $\phi_{DC1}$ measured at the drift chamber layer 1 are chosen to define the good efficiency regions of the detector. The reason for the choice of the variable $\theta_{vtx}$ should be obvious because it is directly related with the kinematic variables \qsqs and $W$ used in the analysis. However, due to the momentum dependent rotational effect of the magnetic field on the reconstructed azimuthal angle ($\phi_{vtx}$) at the vertex, the angle $\phi_{DC1}$ is preferred over $\phi_{vtx}$ to define the fiducial region because that allows the easy selection (rejection) of the events which passed through and got detected by the more (less) reliable central (marginal) regions of the drift chambers. %kp: 12/6/13 after SEK insistence
After a careful and extensive study of the event distributions on both data and simulation, we arrived at the fiducial cuts in terms of the two variables $\theta_{vtx}$ and $\phi_{DC1}$ as shown by the magenta lines in Fig. \ref{figfidCts}.% This cut allowed the maximum possible inclusion of the high efficiency regions of

In addition, the data and simulation were also directly compared with each other by taking the ratio of their distributions in a two dimensional space defined in terms of two variables $\theta_{vtx}$ and the torus current normalized inverse momentum (i.e. $ I_{torus}/(2250 p)$. In one case, the ratio was taken between %the ND$_3$ experimental data and the deuteron simulation %12/1/13
the regular experimental data and the "EC-only" experimental data (with CC-signal not required in the event trigger) (see Fig. \ref{figRegByEConly}) %{figangCts1})
 and in the other case, the ratio was of the experimental deuteron data (after background subtraction) to the simulated deuteron data (see Fig. \ref{figangCts2}). From these comparisons, some of the regions that showed big CC-inefficiencies or big discrepancies between data and simulation were selected and removed from the fiducial region %defined in terms of some more cuts 
as indicated by various straight lines in the two plots.

%p. 116: We used the polar angle at the vertex NOT because it isn't affected by the target magnetic field (it most certainly is), but because the acceptance is defined by the range in scattering angle (as you showed earlier, dOm = sintheta dtheta dphi). For the same reason, we SHOULD have chosen phi at the vertex, as well; however, since the effect of the target field on phi is just a constant offset (rotation around the z-axis), the range phi_max - phi_min is the same at DC1 as at the vertex, giving the same acceptance. We chose DC1 because that's what actually limits the phi acceptance. As you understand, this section is not yet complete. You need to explain that we use the amount of bending (Itor/p*2250) as a 3rd variable, since E'=p is the third variable the determines the acceptance, but the amount of bending has direct correlation to where on the CC a track ends (i.e., the phi range). (You should move the corresponding explanation of ip up from p.122).                      You should also show a couple more plots with different Itor/p*2250 as well as a couple of plots for the simulation to convince the reader that our choices are robust.                   Figs. 51a and 51b should be given a full width each since they have a lot of information and are hard to read otherwise (make them two different figures). I also am confused about your explanation for Fig. 51a):                  I seem to remember that we divided ND3 for standard trigger by ND3 for EC only trigger;  dividing ND3 data by D simulation seems to make little sense. Please check!
