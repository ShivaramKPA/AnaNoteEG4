%  Comparison of Experimental & Simulation data 
%       (to determine the scaling factors (which includes all the unknown experimental constants/factors 
%             such as PbPt, Luminosity etc.)
%       Discuss the issues that we came across & dealt with (refer back to the event selection cuts, DC-shadow etc)

%   I am not sure how to transition from here to Results & Discussion (perhaps, I should have all in one, in this same chap.)

%
%  Extraction of g1 & the calculation of other related physics quantities (Gamma1 etc.)
%       g1, Gamma1, GDH integral, polarizabilities
%       Statistical & systematical uncertainties/errors
