\subsection{Momentum Correction}
Different DC related factors contribute to the biggest part of the systematic deviations of particle momenta as reconstructed by RECSIS. The drift chambers could be misaligned relative to their nominal positions or the survey results that is used by RECSIS could be inaccurate or out-of-date. The effects of physical deformations (due to thermal and stress distortions) of the chamber including wire-sag, incorrect wire positions may not have been incorporated properly. The torus field map used by the reconstruction software may not have been accurate and complete enough \cite{e6momcor_cn}. Effects on angles \th and \ph due to these contributions are already factored in the tracking correction described earlier. However, a separate method is developed to correct for the effect on the magnitude $p$ of the momentum. This $p$-correction methods picks up and builds on some of the ideas outlined in the CLAS-NOTE 2003-005 \cite{e6momcor_cn}.

\subsubsection{Procedure to determine the first 11 parameters}
\label{pCorFit1}
The procedure involved dividing the covered kinematic space into a number of bins, finding in them the magnitude of shifts of the inclusive 
elastic peaks w.r.t. the expected position and use that to fit to a function to get an analytical expression for the correction. The 
following angular bins were used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Six $\theta_{dc1}$ bins: (0,8),(8,10),(10,12),(12,15),(15,20),(20,30) degrees
\item Five $\phi_{dc1}$ bins: (-10,-6),(-6,-2), (-2,2), (2,6), (6,10) degrees 
\end{itemize}
where the angles used are the ones measured at the first drift chamber and $\phi_{dc1}$ is measured w.r.t the sector mid-plane (thus the 
maximum range allowed is (-30.0,30.0)).
  
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqElasticEprime}
E'_{elastic} = \frac{E_{beam}}{1+\frac{2E_{beam}}{M_p}sin^2(\theta_e/2)}
\end{eqnarray}

%\textcolor{red}{To be expanded later on.}

In each of these kinematic bins, the quantity $\Delta E = E'_{elastic} - p$ (see Eq. \ref{eqElasticEprime}) is histogrammed for both NH$_3$ and $^{12}$C data separately. Next, the carbon histogram is cross-normalized with the ammonia histogram (by comparing the two in the region left to the quasi-elastic peak) and subtracted from the latter one to remove the nuclear background. The difference gives  histograms for the elastic events (as shown by the dashed green histogram in Fig. \ref{sec6dEall}). A Gaussian fit to the extracted elastic histogram gives the position and width of the distribution. The offset or shift of average position of the peak with respect to the expected $\Delta E = 0$ gives us the needed correction on energy $E \approx p$ for the electron. This process is repeated for all of the bins listed above and the corresponding $\Delta E$ offsets or the corrections are determined for each of them. Additionally, $\Delta E$ distributions using $^{15}N$ nuclear mass in calculating $E'_{elastic}$ are also made and off-sets in the corresponding elastic peaks are also recorded whenever possible (particularly from the lower \th bins from low beam energy data where the nuclear-elastic and quasi-elastic peaks are well separated).

Finally, these values of corrections for different average values of $\theta_{dc1}$ and $\phi_{dc1}$ are fit to Eq. \ref{eqPCor} (which is based on similar work done for EG1b analysis\cite{nGuler_th})
and using the method of \chisq-minimization in order to determine the values of the 11 fit parameters.


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqPCor}
\frac{\Delta p}{p} = Pcorr1 + Pcorr2 + PatchCorr
\end{eqnarray}
where, $\frac{\Delta p}{p}$ is the ratio of the correction ($\Delta p$) to the magnitude ($p$) of the momentum and 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqPCor1}
%\frac{\Delta p}{p} = ((E+F\phi)\frac{cos\theta}{sin\phi} + (G+H\phi)sin\theta)\frac{p}{qB_{torus}}  %Smallest normal sized parentheses
%\frac{\Delta p}{p} = \big( (E+F\phi)\frac{cos\theta}{sin\phi} + (G+H\phi)sin\theta   \big) \frac{p}{qB_{torus}} % same as above
%\frac{\Delta p}{p} = \Big( (E+F\phi)\frac{cos\theta}{sin\phi} + (G+H\phi)sin\theta   \Big) \frac{p}{qB_{torus}} %Bigger parentheses
%\frac{\Delta p}{p} = \bigg( (E+F\phi)\frac{cos\theta}{sin\phi} + (G+H\phi)sin\theta   \bigg) \frac{p}{qB_{torus}} %Bigger parentheses
Pcorr1 = \left( (E+F\phi)\frac{cos\theta}{sin\phi} + (G+H\phi)sin\theta   \right) \frac{p}{qB_{torus}} %Biggest parentheses
\end{eqnarray}


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqPCor2}
%\frac{\Delta p}{p} = (J cos\theta + K sin\theta) + (M cos\theta+N sin\theta)\phi
Pcorr2 = (J cos\theta + K sin\theta) + (M cos\theta+N sin\theta)\phi
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqPatchCor}
PatchCorr = 0.02\left(P + (Q + R\frac{\phi_{deg}}{30^\circ})(\frac{10^\circ}{\theta_{deg}})^3 \right) 
\end{eqnarray}

The quantity $B_{tor}$ stands for $\int{B_{\perp}dl}$ along the track length multiplied by the speed of light in the units 
of m/ns (c = 0.29979 m/ns) and is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqBtor1}
%B_{tor} = 0.76 \frac{I_{tor}sin^2(4\theta)}{3375\theta/rad} \quad  for \quad  \theta < \frac{\pi}{8} %itallic text 'for'
B_{tor} = 0.76 \frac{I_{tor}sin^2(4\theta)}{3375\theta/rad} \quad  \rm{for} \quad  \theta < \frac{\pi}{8} %Roman (no itallic)
%B_{tor} = 0.76 \frac{I_{tor}sin^2(4\theta)}{3375\theta/rad} \quad  \mathrm{for} \quad  \theta < \frac{\pi}{8} %Roman (no itallic)
%B_{tor} = 0.76 \frac{I_{tor}sin^2(4\theta)}{3375\theta/rad} \quad  \textrm{for} \quad  \theta < \frac{\pi}{8} %Roman (no itallic)
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqBtor2}
B_{tor} = 0.76 \frac{I_{tor}}{3375\theta/rad}  \quad  \textrm{for}  \quad  \theta > \frac{\pi}{8}
\end{eqnarray}

In all these equations, sector number, $\theta$, $\phi$, $\theta_{deg}$, and $\phi_{deg}$ come from the angle information measured at DC1. The direction cosine variables tl1\_cx, tl1\_cy, tl1\_cz (from pass1 ntuples) are used to derive these quantities. C++ standard functions acos() and atan2() are used to evaluate $\theta$, $\phi$ (w.r.t the sector mid plane). %(One should take an extra care of the fact that the function atan2() gives the values of azimuthal angle $\phi$ between -$\pi$ to +$\pi$.) %SEK cor 12/4/13



These total of eleven unknown parameters were determined by fitting above mentioned momentum offsets (in combination with ionization energy loss correction for electrons (see Sec.\ref{secElossCor} below)) to the correction function given by the Eq. \ref{eqPCor}.

nucleii in the ammonia target. It would have been best to have data from $^{15}$N target itself but due to technical difficulties
that was not possible and, therefore, $^{12}$C target was chosen as the closest possible approximation of $^{15}$N target.}

In the second plot, the proton elastic peak is also visible. Ideally, after all the corrections, the nuclear elastic peak is 
expected to be centered at zero. But, as is obvious from these figures, these peaks show offsets. These offsets (given
by the mean values of the Gaussian fits) are collected from those bins in which the nuclear elastic peaks are very well
separated (particularly the first few angular bins) and used in the $\chi^2$-minimization along with all the offsets of
elastic peaks (see Fig. \ref{sec6dEall})}

\subsection{Outgoing Ionization Loss Correction}
\label{secElossCor}
 
%    \sqrt[root]{arg} The \sqrt command produces the square root of its argument. The optional argument, root, determines what root 
%    to produce, i.e., the cube root of x+y  would be typed as  $\sqrt[3]{x+y}$
In addition to the corrections described above, the energy (E) of each of the particles is corrected for the outgoing ionization loss by adding an estimation of ionization loss as follows: $E_{cor} = E + \Delta E $ with $\Delta E = \frac{dE}{dX}\tau$ % $\Delta E = (\frac{\Delta E/\Delta X}{1000.0})gm$,
where the factor $\tau$ is the total effective mass thickness traversed by the particle and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqElossEl}
%\Delta E/ \Delta X = 2.8 ~MeV \quad \rm{for ~electrons}
dE/dX \approx 2.8 ~\rm{MeV/(g ~cm}^{-2}\rm{)} \quad \rm{for ~electrons}
\end{eqnarray}
and, for hadrons \cite{leo1994techniques}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqElossHad}
%%%if( mass < 0.01) DEDX = 2.8;    else DEDX = 0.307 * ( 0.5 / Beta2 ) * ( log( 2. * 511000.0 * Beta2 * ( Gamma2 / 90. ) ) - Beta2 );
%%%\Delta E/ \Delta X = 0.307 (\frac{ 0.5}{ \beta^2}) \left( log\bigg( 2.0( 511000.0 \beta^2) (\frac{ \gamma^2}{ 90.0} ) \bigg) - \beta^2 \right);
%%%\Delta E/ \Delta X = 0.307 (\frac{ 0.5}{ \beta^2}) \left( ln\bigg( 2.0( 511000.0 \beta^2) (\frac{ \gamma^2}{ 90.0} ) \bigg) - \beta^2 \right) ~MeV ~\rm{for ~hadrons}

dE/dX \approx 0.307 \times \frac{ 0.5}{ \beta^2} \left( ln\bigg( 2.0 \times 511.0 \frac{\beta^2 \gamma^2}{ 0.090} \bigg) - \beta^2 \right) \rm{~MeV} 
\end{eqnarray}

which is an approximation of the Bethe-Block formula \cite{leo1994techniques}: % (Eq.(\ref{eqBetheBlock})).

%And, the factor '$\tau$' is the total effective mass thickness traversed by the particle. 
%This quantity is calculated as follows:
The total effective mass thickness $\tau$ (in cm) is calculated as follows: %xz
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau = \tau_{\parallel}/cos\theta$ \quad if $\theta <= \pi/4$
\item $\tau = \tau_{\parallel}/cos(\pi/4)$ \quad if $\theta > \pi/4$    %SEK comment:  I don't understand. leave out! Why not \tau = r/sin \theta    (anyway \theta > \pi/4 is never true!
\end{itemize}
where $\tau_{\parallel}$ is calculated as:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau_{\parallel} = \Delta z \times 0.6 + 0.4$ \quad if $\Delta z > 0.0 $ and $\Delta z < 1.0 $

\item $\tau_{\parallel} = 0.4$ \quad if $\Delta z \leq  0.0$
%\item $\tau_{\parallel} = 0.75$ \quad if otherwise
\end{itemize}
with $\Delta z = z_{target\_center} - z_{ave} + L_{target}/2 = (-101.0$ cm $ - z_{ave} + 0.5)$ cm being the physical distance (along the target length) traveled by the particle through the polarized target material (e.g. the EG4 ND$_3$ target has length 1.0 cm and is positioned at z = -101.0 cm). The factor 0.6 is the effective mass thickness of ND$_3$ (density of ND$_3$ ($\sim 1 ~g/cm^3$) %(e.g. one of the EG4 NH$_3$ (ND$_3$ too) target has length 1.0 cm and is positioned at z = -101.0 cm). The factor 0.6 is the effective mass thickness of NH$_3$ (density of NH$_3$ ($\sim 1 ~g/cm^3$) 
multiplied by the packing fraction which is roughly 0.6  \cite{rferschAnaNote},%{rfersch_th},
whereas 0.4 is the sum of the mass thicknesses of He ($\sim 0.3$) and that of window foils ($\sim 0.1$) \cite{nGuler_th}. %In fact these numbers were for NH3 targets and were decided when our own values for PFs were not available which are now at about 0.7 (I believe, this won't make things much different, may be systematic study has to be done. 12/5/13)

Using the ionization loss corrected energy and the rest mass of the particle, momentum is recalculated as $p_{cor} = \sqrt{E^2_{cor}-m^2}$ 
(where $m$ is the mass of the particle). Finally, this new p is used along with the previously corrected angles to evaluate the three 
cartesian components $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$ of the momentum as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  p_x   = & p \sin\theta \cos\phi \\
  p_y   = & p \sin\theta \sin\phi \\
  p_z   = & p \cos\theta
