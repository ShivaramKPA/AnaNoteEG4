\chapter{Radiative Corrections}
\label{cha:RadiativeCorrections}
%
When a cross-section is measured experimentally, the measurement yields the radiated cross-section plus contributions from radiated exclusive events, not the desired Born cross-section.
There are seven leading order contributions to the measured cross-section, summarized in figure~\ref{fig:radiatedFeynmanDiagrams}.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish these processes on the level of event selection, radiative corrections are therefore needed.
HAPRAD version 2.0 \cite{Akushevich99}\cite{Akushevich09} was used to calculate radiative corrections.

HAPRAD works by calculating $\sigma_{rad+tail} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)$ for a given \allowbreak $\sigma_{Born} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)$ which is obtained from a model.
The radiative correction factor is then simply
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RCfactor}
RC\ factor \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right) = \frac{\sigma_{rad+tail} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)}{\sigma_{Born} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)}
\end{equation}
and the Born cross-section can be obtained by dividing the measured cross-section by the RC factor, i.e., $\sigma_{Born} = \sigma_{measured}/\text{RC factor}$.
Three different models were used to study model dependence, which proved to be a small effect (see chapter~\ref{cha:SystematicUncertainties} which discusses systematic uncertainties).

Some results from HAPRAD are shown in figures~\ref{fig:RCmagnitude_4D_intPhih} and~\ref{fig:RC_zPT2grid_x0QQ0}.
Figure~\ref{fig:RCmagnitude_4D_intPhih} shows the magnitude of the RC factor (integrated over $\phi_h$) as a function of $z$ and $P_{h\perp}^2$ for each of the nine $x$-$Q^2$ bins.
These results are very reasonable as they don't deviate very far from unity within the relevant kinematic ranges.
The kinematic region highlighted by the red rectangle in the bottom-left plot of figure~\ref{fig:RCmagnitude_4D_intPhih} is shown in more detail in figure~\ref{fig:RC_zPT2grid_x0QQ0}, which shows the $\phi_h$ dependence of $\sigma_{Born}$ (obtained from a model), $\sigma_{rad}$, and $\sigma_{tail}$ at different values of $z$ and $P_{h\perp}^2$ for fixed $x$ and $Q^2$.
